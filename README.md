🧠 Stoneale – Fun Meets Mental Wellness

Stoneale is a mental health gaming platform designed to make emotional well-being fun, engaging, and accessible. Our mission is to transform how people approach mental health by blending play, community, and science-backed wellness experiences.

🌍 Vision

We believe mental health care should be approachable and stigma-free. Stoneale bridges the gap between entertainment and therapy by helping users unwind, connect, and heal — one game at a time.

🚀 How It Works

Stoneale integrates casual gaming, mood tracking, and AI-driven insights to create personalised mental wellness experiences.

🎮 Play to Heal: Short, interactive games designed to reduce stress and improve mood.

💬 Community Vibes: Safe spaces where users can connect and share experiences.

🧩 AI Wellness Engine: Personalised recommendations for activities, mood boosters, and professional help when needed.

🔗 Blockchain Adoption

Stoneale plans to adopt blockchain technology to enhance transparency, security, and user empowerment.
Our blockchain integration will focus on:

Digital Wellness Assets: Tokenised in-app rewards for engagement and wellness achievements.

User Data Sovereignty: Enabling users to control and selectively share their health-related data.

Transparent Impact Tracking: Leveraging smart contracts (on Algorand) to measure and verify our social impact outcomes — such as engagement rates, mental wellness improvements, and therapist accessibility.

This approach ensures that every game session, reflection, and community interaction contributes to a verifiable impact ledger for mental health improvement.
